# Topics in Computer Security


## Server Side:
Implemented server based cloud using Heroku (http://www.heroku.com) <br />
Built Server API with Node.js (based JavaScript)  <br />
Support for multiplie users based on database with username and password credintels.   <br />
Passwords are hashed-stored (with salt) in the MongoDB  <br />
Users can read\strore data according to their permissions  <br />
Unallowed users canâ€™t login to our app  <br />
 <br /> <br />

## Client Side: 
Building extension to Chrome based JavaScript  <br />
Once the user downloaded the app, he registers as a new user with username and password for his choice.  <br />
After that, the user connects to the server via the plugin.  <br />
Each password file is stored in a different collection on the server  <br />
Meanwhile, the password is displayed in site (if stored), otherwise asks user to store if after login. (if password are not equal - asks for update)
